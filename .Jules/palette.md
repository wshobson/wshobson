## 2025-12-22 - Badges for Contact Links
**Learning:** Using `style=for-the-badge` for primary call-to-action links (like social profiles) significantly increases their visual weight and clickability compared to standard bulleted lists.
**Action:** Default to badge-style links for "About Me" / "Contact" sections in profile READMEs.
